# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mauno Elo!

I'm a motivated and curious software developer from Finland with a strong interest in full stack development and artificial intelligence. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean code and thoughtful design.

I come from a background in logistics and warehouse operations, which has taught me responsibility, attention to detail, and working under pressure â€” all of which I now apply in software development.

## ðŸ”§ My Skills & Tools

- Frontend: **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux**, **React Native**
- Backend: **Node.js**, **GraphQL**, **Express**
- Databases: **MongoDB**, learning **PostgreSQL**
- Testing: **Jest**, **React Testing Library**
- Dev tools: **Git**, **GitHub**
- Other: Strong understanding of systems, workflows, and problem-solving

ðŸ’¡ Currently expanding my skills through the [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by the University of Helsinki.
